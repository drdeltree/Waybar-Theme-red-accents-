## Waybar Themes for linux

 A collection of my Waybar themes – have fun exploring and customizing them!

## Installation

To get the basic functionality, it’s enough to copy only the config.jsonc and style.css files  — everything else is optional add-ons, such as wttrbar or waybar-pacman <br>

```bash
  yay -S wttrbar
```
```bash
  yay -S waybar-module-pacman-updates-git
```
- Copy the downloaded config.jsonc and style.css files (these are usually located in your ~/Downloads/ folder) and replace the existing configuration files in <br>
- Create a backup of your current config.jsonc and style.css before replacing them  
```
cp -r ~/Downloads/config.jsonc ~/.config/waybar/
```
```
cp -r ~/Downloads/style.css ~/.config/waybar/
```

After that, restart your Waybar by typing:
```
omarchy-restart-waybar
```
